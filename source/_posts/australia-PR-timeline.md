> 2020 is a absolute special year in every perspective. So many tragedies across the world happened since the COVID-19, it has changed not only economic of the world, also of how we work, interact as human beings. I want to record something positive in my life out of these tough time, we all need some.

I've officially obtained Australia PR via [186](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/employer-nomination-scheme-186) at the beginning of this year!! how exciting! Here is the timeline of the process:
-	**02/21/2020 nomination lodged**
-	**02/24/2020 nomination approved**:smile:
-	**02/24/2020 application lodged**
-	**02/28/2020 medical exams finished**
-	**03/16/2020 application approved**:boom:

#	总结
总体来说，animation比transform + transition强大一点点，具体使用哪个要视具体需求而定。   
目前大部分主流浏览器都已经兼容以上几个属性，但是为了兼容安卓系统保险起见最好加上-webkit-keyframes, 用animation的时候也加上-webkit-animation，如果觉得每次都要这么写太麻烦的话可以用例如sass中的mixin功能帮助我们减少代码，关于这部分内容我我会在之后写一篇博文详细描述。
